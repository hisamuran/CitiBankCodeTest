Test 1. Visitor
- Descrirption:
Create an interface or abstract base class 'Shape'. Implement three concrete Shapes: 'Circle', 'Rectangle', 'Triangle'. Apply the visitor pattern to your data model. Write an AreaVisitor that computes the area of the shapes. Write a program that makes arbitrary instances of the data model and uses the AreaVisitor to calculate the total area of the instances.
- Instructions to execute:
Go the src\test folder and execute the test class AreaVisitorTest.java, this has several shapes that execute the visit method to calculate the area and output it to the console.


Test 2. Paper Scissors Rock
- Descrirption:
Paper Scissors Rock is a game for two players. Each player simultaneously opens his/her hand to display a symbol: Fist equals rock, open hand equals paper, index and middle finger equals scissors. The winner is determined by the following schema: paper beats (wraps) rock, rock beats (blunts) scissors, scissors beats (cuts) paper. Write a program that plays Paper Scissors Rock between the computer and a real player. You should be able to play the game n times before the program exits.
Generalise from these requirements as you wish and demonstrate that you can write clear, maintainable, and extensible code.
- Instructions to execute:
In the src\main\java folder execute the main method in the class PaperScissorsRockGame.java
